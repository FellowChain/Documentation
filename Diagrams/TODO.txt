Flow Charts:

1) KYC of people registering new Cooperative
2) Adding New Users to cooperative (who accepts them, how KYC is processed?)
3) Funds Flow from system user dues (Cooperative operational Fund, Claims Fund, Global Budget)
4) Claim Approval/Rejection Flow. 
4.1) Users Voting Logic
5) Arbitration of other Cooperatives (that need to be carefully thought throught to secure independence)
6) User refund when leaving cooperative (dependent on having any approved claims?)
7) Cooperative Management (% fee change, dues amount change, statut change)
